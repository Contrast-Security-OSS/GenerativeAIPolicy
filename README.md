Welcome to the official repository for the Generatice AI Policy!

## Overview


## Key Focus

The primary aim of this project is to provide a comprehensible and adoptable policy to control the potential privacy and security risks in using Generatice AI and LLMs within your organization. this open source policy serves as a starting point for CISOs, security professionals, compliance, and risk teams who are new to this domain, and those who have a need to quickly release a policy for their organizations. 

The policy takes into account numerous things but the primary focuses were on the following:

* Prevent the creation of Inellectual Property (IP) and software where ownership and IP rights cannot be successfully challenged at a later time;
* Prevent the generation of or using AI-generated code that could contain malicious components;
* Prevent employees from using public AI systems to learn from the company’s data or customers’ or other third parties’ proprietary, non-public data; and
* Prevent unauthorized or under-privileged users gaining access to privileged, sensitive, protected or other confidential data.
